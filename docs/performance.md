# Performance

*Copied from [go-crdt/crdt `docs/performance.md`](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/blob/8aefdc0/docs/performance.md) at `8aefdc0` (v0.55.3). This page is a copy: when the two differ, the one in the crdt repository is the measurement and this is a stale transcript of it.*

## On the trace everybody publishes against

The sequential editing traces at [josephg/editing-traces](https://github.com/josephg/editing-traces)
are the common yardstick for text CRDTs — Yjs, Automerge and diamond-types all
report against them. `automerge-paper` is the canonical one: **259 778
single-character edits** recorded from someone actually writing a paper, ending
in 104 852 characters with 77 463 tombstones.

Apple M4 Max, Go 1.26.4, `darwin/arm64`:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| replay the whole history locally | **18.4 ms** — 71 ns/edit |
| apply the same history as a peer's operations | **52.9 ms** — 204 ns/operation |
| deliver it **back to front**, nothing applicable until the last operation | **0.25 s** |
| memory held afterwards | **4.3 MiB** — 24.6 bytes per character including tombstones |
| the document encoded | **260 KB** — 2.5 bytes per visible character |

Reproduce it, and check the result against the recorded final text:

```sh
curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephg/editing-traces/master/sequential_traces/automerge-paper.json.gz
CRDT_TRACE=automerge-paper.json.gz go test -run TestEditingTrace -v
CRDT_TRACE=automerge-paper.json.gz go test -run '^$' -bench EditingTrace -benchtime 5x
```

The replay is a correctness test before it is a benchmark: a quarter of a million
edits at positions a real person chose, with the answer known in advance, plus a
snapshot round trip and a full reload. CI runs it on every change.

## Measured against other implementations

The numbers above are ours. Setting them beside the figures other projects
publish would compare four machines, so the other implementations were run here
instead: same machine, same trace, same protocol, on 2026-08-16.

Every implementation is driven the way its own published benchmark drives it,
and every run rebuilds the document and compares it against the `endContent`
recorded in the trace before any time is reported — a replay that produces the
wrong text fails rather than printing a number. Verification is outside the
clock. The harness is in [`docs/comparison/`](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/blob/main/docs/comparison/): one file with one
timing loop and one adapter per library, so the measurement cannot differ
between them.

Apple M4 Max (16 cores, 128 GiB), macOS 26.6.2, Go 1.26.4 `darwin/arm64`,
Node v26.4.0. Twelve interleaved rounds of
[`docs/comparison/paired.js`](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/blob/main/docs/comparison/paired.js) — one replay per arm in
rotation, each process staying warm — on a machine whose `load1` fell from 4.7 to
3.1 across the run and never rose above 6.7. The `×` column is the **median of
the per-round ratios**, which is what pairing buys; the `min–max` column is the
spread of the raw times.

| Implementation | Runs on | Replay (median) | ns/edit | × ours | min–max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| diamond-types 1.0.2 | Rust → WebAssembly | **18.5 ms** | 71 | **0.91×** | 17.7–31.4 ms |
| **go-crdt/crdt** | Go | **20.0 ms** | 77 | 1.00× | 19.5–21.1 ms |
| list-positions 2.0.0 (Fugue) | JavaScript | 173.1 ms | 666 | 8.74× | 168.5–211.2 ms |
| loro-crdt 1.16.3 | Rust → WebAssembly | 186.2 ms | 717 | 9.31× | 185.1–213.4 ms |
| yjs 13.6.33 | JavaScript | 3 101 ms | 11 936 | 156× | 3 073–3 216 ms |
| @automerge/automerge 3.5.0 | Rust → WebAssembly, JS wrapper | 3 875 ms | 14 916 | 194× | 3 858–4 069 ms |
| @automerge/automerge-wasm 1.0.0-preview.0 | Rust → WebAssembly | 8 247 ms | 31 748 | 411× | 8 197–8 394 ms |

**diamond-types is still faster than we are**, by about a tenth, and that is the
result. It is the fastest text CRDT anyone has published and it stays that way
here. Its one wide round — 31.4 ms against a median of 18.5 — is its native
module warming up on the first round; every later round is within 17.7–20.2 ms.

The honest reading is that we are in its range on this trace, and ahead of
everything else measured. What that costs in a property rather than throughput is
the section after next.

### What re-taking it showed

The table this replaces was taken in blocks — each library its own command, its
own stretch of wall-clock time — before `paired.js` existed. Re-taking it is how
three things came out.

**The instrument reproduces what did not change.** diamond-types and
`automerge-wasm` are the same versions as before and land on the same numbers:
18.4 → 18.5 ms and 8 262 → 8 247 ms. Yjs moved one patch release and 3 079 →
3 101 ms. Nothing here says the new protocol measures differently from the old
one, which is what makes the two rows that *did* move worth reading.

**Automerge is 6.9× faster than it was, and the old figure was right when it was
taken.** 3.4.1 published at 26 492 ms; 3.5.0 reads 3 875 ms. Installed side by
side and run alternately on this machine, 3.4.1 reads 26 843–28 731 ms and 3.5.0
reads 3 997–4 016 ms, so the change is the library's and not ours. It also
reverses the bottom of the table: the JS wrapper is now **twice as fast as the
raw WebAssembly binding** it wraps, where it used to be three times slower.

**Loro reads 186 ms where 692 ms was published, and the version is not the
reason.** `loro-crdt` moved 1.14.1 → 1.16.3, so that was the first thing to
check: 1.14.1 reinstalled and run today reads 198–216 ms. The adapter has been
touched by exactly one commit — the one that introduced this harness and
published that table — and Node is the same v26.4.0, and the published protocol
(`--runs 10`) reproduces at 192 ms. So: not the version, not the adapter, not the
runtime, not the protocol.

What is left is the state of the machine during that block, and the published row
carries the mark of it — its spread was **573–1007 ms, a factor of 1.76**, where
every other row in that table spanned 1.02 to 1.34. Contention of the right size
does reach that magnitude: under twelve busy loops loro barely moves (191 → 197
ms), but under thirty-two, three times oversubscribed, it reads 397–551 ms. That
is the neighbourhood of the published figure without being a proof of it, and it
is as far as this can be taken — the run itself is not repeatable.

**That is the third thing a block design cost this document**, after the Fugue
row being 14% out and the diamond-types comparison being made across two
sessions. This one is the worst of the three and the least visible: a single row
3.5× too slow while every row around it was correct, which is exactly what giving
each library its own stretch of time allows and exactly what nothing in the
output says.

### What non-interleaving costs

The table above prices throughput. This row prices a **property**.

`crdt` is an RGA, which is proved free of *forward* interleaving and exhibits the
*backward* kind — type a word, move the cursor back, type another, and somebody
else's concurrent word can land between yours. See `doc.go` and
`TestTwoOfYourCharactersStayTogetherWhenYouTypeForwards`. Fugue (Weidner &
Kleppmann, *The Art of the Fugue*) is proved free of both, and `list-positions`
is its authors' implementation.

So: what would that guarantee cost? It is the `list-positions` row in the table
above — **173 ms against our 20 ms, 8.74×**. Four runs on four occasions put it
at 8.13×, 8.40×, 8.60× and 8.74×, and they line up the way the section below
predicts: the lowest came from the block control and the highest from the
quietest machine, because contention costs our shorter arm more than it costs
Fugue's and so pulls the ratio down.

**About an order of magnitude**, then, and — worth saying because the Fugue paper
compares itself to Yjs — roughly eighteen times faster than Yjs while doing more.

Two things this does not measure. It crosses languages: Fugue here is
JavaScript and we are Go, the same caveat the `Runs on` column carries for every
other row. And its saved document is JSON — 493 KB against our 260 KB of binary —
which compares encodings, not designs, so it is left out of the size table below.

#### The first version of this row said 9.6×, and that was 14% too high

It was measured by running `bench.js fugue`, then `bench.js yjs`, then the Go
benchmark: each arm its own command, each its own stretch of wall-clock time. The
machine was busy, the text said so, and it excused itself on the reasoning that
whatever the machine was doing landed on all three alike.

It does not land on all three alike. That is worth more than the row it corrects.

Under twelve busy loops, interleaved so that every arm meets the same machine:

| | ours | Fugue | Fugue ÷ ours |
|---|---|---|---|
| spare cores | 20.9 ms | 177 ms | **8.4×** |
| twelve busy loops | 42.5 ms (**×2.04**) | 227 ms (×1.28) | **5.4×** |

Contention costs us twice what it costs Fugue, so a busy machine moves the ratio
by a third — *towards* Fugue. Four things follow.

**A busy machine flatters whatever you are slower than.** The penalty fell
hardest on the fastest arm and least on the slowest — ours ×2.04, Fugue ×1.28,
Yjs ×1.23 — so contention shrinks a lead rather than distributing itself. A
comparison run on a loaded workstation understates whoever is winning, and the
error is not noise: it has a direction.

**Most of that is the length of the window, not the language.** A 21 ms
measurement loses a whole scheduling quantum where a 180 ms one absorbs it, and
the fastest implementation necessarily has the shortest window. Timing eight
consecutive replays under one clock — `--repeats ours=8`, so our sample lasts
168 ms like Fugue's — takes our inflation from ×2.04 to **×1.42** and the ratio
from 5.4× back to 7.6×. That is more than half of the gap, and it is not all of
it: at equal window length we still lose somewhat more than Fugue does.

**The minimum recovers some of the rest, and the literature says why it cannot
recover all of it.** Chen and Revels model the environment as adding delay and
never removing it (*Robust benchmarking in noisy environments*, IEEE HPEC 2016,
the strategy in Julia's `BenchmarkTools`): if every error term is positive then
the smallest sample is the one with the least error in it, which is why they
estimate with the minimum rather than the mean or the median. On the contended
run the minimum does pull the ratio from 5.4× back to 7.4× without any change to
how the arms are driven. But their equation (9) is the reason it stops there —
repetition removes a delay that *sometimes* fires, not one that fires on every
execution, and a starved CPU is the second kind. 7.4× is still 12% short of 8.4×.
The minimum is a better estimator, not a substitute for a machine with a spare
core.

**A load average cannot label a measurement.** It is an exponential average over
a minute, so it lags in both directions. The first round of the contended run
read `load1` 10.69, a value the uncontended block control had spent its whole run
inside, while the twelve busy loops were already there and every arm was already
slow: ours 27.5 ms against 19.9–21.8, Fugue 215 ms against 171–191. `paired.js`
records `load1` beside every timing so a reader can see what it said, not so a
result can be justified by it.

Why it survived: **this document already had the habit, for the comparison it
makes often.** Every measurement of one of our releases against another says how
it was taken — beside the release before it on the same machine in one session,
and the UTF-16 pair alternately, build against build. It was the comparisons with
*other* implementations, made rarely, that were left to whatever the machine was
doing. The discipline was there; it had simply never been pointed outward.

One thing this does *not* say: that running each implementation as its own
command is wrong. `--block` does exactly that with the same processes and the
same code, and on a machine whose load is steady it agrees with the interleaved
form to within the spread — 8.1× against 8.4×. Blocks are not wrong; they are
unprotected, and nothing in their output says which of the two they were. The
table above them was taken that way, before `paired.js` existed, and has not been
re-run.

### Document size, where we do badly

Encoding the replayed document:

| Implementation | Encoded document | Through gzip -6 | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| diamond-types 1.0.2 | 109 KB † | 93 KB | 1.17× |
| @automerge/automerge 3.4.1 | 129 KB | **129 KB** | **1.00×** |
| yjs 13.6.32 (V2 encoding) | 160 KB | 70 KB | 2.30× |
| loro-crdt 1.15.1 | 251 KB | 193 KB | 1.30× |
| yjs 13.6.32 (V1 encoding) | 311 KB | 105 KB | 2.96× |
| **go-crdt/crdt**, format version 8 | **260 KB** | **113 KB** | **2.31×** |
| *go-crdt/crdt 0.15.0* | *478 KB* | *116 KB* | *4.13×* |
| *go-crdt/crdt 0.14.0* | *527 KB* |
| *go-crdt/crdt 0.5.0* | *620 KB* |
| *go-crdt/crdt 0.4.0, when this was measured* | *2 663 KB* |

**Re-verified on 2026-09-30, and every row reproduces.** Sizes do not depend on
what the machine was doing, so this half of the comparison was never exposed to
what the timing table above had to be re-taken for — and saying so is only worth
anything because it was checked: diamond-types at 108 996 bytes, Yjs at 159 929
and 311 038, ours at 259 890, all to the byte.

Each row is labelled with the version that produced it — including when the pin
moves under it, as `loro-crdt` has twice. The harness installs **1.16.4** today;
it encodes this document into the same **251 391 bytes** as 1.16.3, to the byte,
and a paired run against it replays in 188.7 ms, inside the 185.1–213.4 ms the
table above records. Neither row is re-taken for it, because a row measured on a
different day under a different load is the thing this page spent #132 removing.

Two other versions have moved without moving a format either. **Automerge 3.5.0
encodes this document into exactly the same 129 103 bytes as 3.4.1** — the 6.9×
it gained in speed cost nothing and bought nothing here — and loro 1.16.3 lands
33 bytes from 1.15.1 on a 251 KB document. So the table is current to within
those 33 bytes, not merely correct as taken.

This is what the comparison was for. At 0.4.0 ours was between eight and
twenty-four times larger than anyone else's, because `Snapshot` wrote one record
per character while everyone else writes runs. Version 2 of the format writes
runs too, which took it to 620 KB.

† **diamond-types compresses its text inside its own format**, so its first
column is not an uncompressed figure. `Cargo.toml` has `default = ["lz4",
"storage"]`, and `src/list/encoding/encode_oplog.rs` puts content in a
`ContentCompressed` chunk for any document over twenty bytes:

```rust
// Right now I'm compressing content whenever len > 20.
const MIN_COMPRESSED_LEN: usize = 20;
```

Its text — the part that is 182 KB of plain characters in ours — is LZ4'd in
there. That is corroborated by its gzip ratio: 1.17× on a document whose largest
component is English prose is what is left when the prose is already compressed.
(The crate's defaults are what is quoted; the feature flags the
`diamond-types-node` build uses were not checked.)

So the first column compares one format that compresses the biggest thing in the
file against five that do not, under a single heading. The second column is the
one that compares the same operation applied to everybody.

### Uncompressed is not the only column, and the other one says something else

Uncompressed we are third of six at version 8, behind diamond-types and
Automerge; at version 6 we were last. **Through gzip we are fourth of six**,
ahead of Automerge and Loro, and within a quarter of diamond-types. Both numbers
are true; this page reported only the first one for several releases, which
overstated the gap.

The **ratio** is the part worth reading. **Automerge does not compress at all**:
129 103 bytes in, 129 161 out. It grows by 58 bytes, which is gzip's header on a
stream with nothing left to find. diamond-types manages 1.17×, Loro 1.30×.

Ours was 4.13× and is now 2.31×, and what is left of it is the text: the
structure is 78 KB with next to nothing in it for a compressor to find, and the
182 KB of English prose beside it is not.

Run-length encoding is not a technique to weigh here, it is the baseline: the
diamond-types encoding module opens by saying it "is modelled after the
run-length encoding in Automerge and Yjs", so all three implementations ahead of
us use it and the fastest and smallest says so in its first paragraph.

The 4.13× was a direct measurement of how much redundancy version 6 left in the
file, and it was the same finding as the field-by-field accounting below arrived
at from the other side: three columns held one repeated value and cost 15% of the
file, because there was one encoding here where Automerge picks between a
run-length, a boolean and a delta encoder per column. Its 1.00× is what those
look like from outside. Version 8 picks per column too, and those three columns
now cost twelve bytes between them.

Where it matters depends on who is storing the bytes. `gitstore` writes through
git, which deflates every object; `pgstore` writes a `bytea`, which Postgres
compresses once it is large enough. Both collect most of that 4.13× without
anyone doing anything. `DirStore` and `MemoryStore` do not, and neither does a
transport. See [issue #88](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/issues/88).

### What the gap actually was

This page used to say the rest was the text: "ours is 182 KB of characters
written plainly, which already exceeds their whole document." That was true and
it was not the answer. If the text is 182 KB of 620, something else is 438 KB,
and 438 KB is four times diamond-types' entire document — so compressing the
text would have left most of the gap standing.

That has since been measured rather than reasoned about, on version 6:

| | Bytes |
|---|---|
| the snapshot | 478 474 |
| its text column | 182 315 → 49 637 through gzip (3.67×) |
| everything else | 296 159 |
| the whole thing through gzip | 115 897 (4.13×) |
| **compressing only the text** | **345 796 (1.38×)** |

Of the 362 KB a general-purpose compressor removes from this file, the text is
**133 KB of it and the structure 230 KB**. The text is the largest single
component of the file and it is not where most of the removable redundancy is;
those are different questions. Compressing the text is worth 1.38× on its own —
worth having, and much less work — but the columns are where the larger share
sits. This is the same conclusion the paragraph above reached in 2026 by
subtraction, with the number attached.

`TestSnapshotBudget` accounts for every byte `Snapshot` writes, by the field
that wrote it. On the same document, under version 2:

| Field | Bytes | Share |
|---|---|---|
| deletions | 299 244 | 48.3% |
| the text | 182 315 | 29.4% |
| run identities | 42 444 | 6.8% |
| origins | 42 382 | 6.8% |
| clocks | 31 620 | 5.1% |
| run and field lengths | 21 857 | 3.5% |

The deletions were the largest thing in the file, larger than the text, and on
their own nearly three times diamond-types' whole document. Half of that — 148 KB
— was one field: the sequence number of the operation that did the deleting,
written in full at three bytes each, 50 276 times.

Version 3 writes it as a signed step from the last sequence number that site
deleted with. A person deleting text works through it rather than jumping about,
so the step is usually one byte. Measured before it was built, on this trace:

| That field, written as | Bytes |
|---|---|
| the number itself (version 2) | 148 385 |
| **a step from the previous deletion (version 3)** | **55 828** |
| a step from the run's own sequence | 117 771 |

which is what took the document from 620 KB to 527 KB.

### Then the same question, of what was left

With the deletions halved, the three fields under them were 116 KB between
them, and the same measurement answered the same way:

| Field | In full | As a step | |
|---|---|---|---|
| run identities | 42 444 | **31 273** | a step from the last run by that site |
| origins | 42 382 | **25 484** | a step from the last origin with that site |
| clocks | 31 620 | **10 824** | the distance above the run's own sequence |

The clocks are the interesting one: 10 824 bytes is one byte per run, and it is
not a coincidence. A clock can never fall below its own sequence number — a
site's clock advances at least once per operation it issues — so the distance
between them is small, unsigned, and needs no sign bit. Writing it that way also
means a snapshot can no longer express a clock the loader would have had to
refuse: the invariant moved out of a check and into the format.

Version 4 writes all three. 527 KB to 478 KB, and 620 KB to 478 KB since the
runs were introduced — a 23% cut in two steps, both of them measured first.

What is left is mostly the text: 182 KB of it, 38% of the file, written plainly
because this package has no dependencies and a compressor is a dependency. The
deletions are still 43%, but three quarters of that is now the offsets and spans
themselves rather than the identities attached to them.

### The document size gap is an encoding, not a compressor

At version 4 a real document encodes to 478 KB where diamond-types takes 109 KB,
and this page used to put that down to the text being written plainly. It is not
the text. Compressing the snapshot as it stands takes it to 148 KB — still a
third bigger than their whole document — because the fields are interleaved: a
compressor looking for repetition sees a run's identity beside its text beside
its deletions.

Written one field at a time, each column is a stream of similar numbers, and a
compressor is very good at those. The same document, same fields, same step
encodings, laid out in columns and compressed per column:

| Column | Raw | Compressed |
|---|---|---|
| run sites | 10 824 | **13** |
| clocks | 10 824 | **13** |
| origin sites | 10 824 | **14** |
| deletion counts | 10 850 | 3 978 |
| run lengths | 11 005 | 6 732 |
| origin sequences | 14 660 | 10 824 |
| run sequences | 20 449 | 16 720 |
| deletion fields | 206 687 | **18 181** |
| the text | 182 315 | 40 228 |
| **total** | **478 438** | **96 703** |

Against diamond-types' 111 616 bytes that is **87%**. The deletion fields are the
sharpest: 206 KB to 18, because a column of small gaps and spans repeats itself
in a way the same numbers scattered between other fields do not.

#### Which compressor, measured rather than assumed

Every one of these is pure Go. Same columns, best setting of each:

| | Total | |
|---|---|---|
| **brotli** (`andybalholm/brotli`, q11) | **96 703** | |
| lzma (`ulikunitz/xz`) | 109 149 | +13% |
| zstd (`klauspost/compress`) | 109 201 | +13% |
| xz | 109 564 | +13% |
| flate (standard library) | 112 211 | +16% |

brotli wins on every column, including the small-varint streams where it would
be least expected. Two settings were measured rather than guessed: the window
must be at least 2^20 — at 2^16 it costs 2.4 KB, and past 2^20 nothing changes —
and compressing **per column beats one stream**, 96 703 against 97 811, so the
column boundaries are worth more than the redundancy across them.

That is the one dependency worth taking: it buys 14% against the next best,
where zstd's advantage was one column.

#### And what it costs, which decides the setting

brotli's top quality is very slow. The ladder, per column, on the same 478 KB:

| Quality | Per column | vs diamond-types | Encode |
|---|---|---|---|
| q4 | 112 215 | 101% | 5 ms |
| **q5** | **108 266** | **97%** | **7 ms** |
| **q9** | **106 169** | **95%** | **14 ms** |
| q10 | 98 686 | 88% | 167 ms |
| q11 | 96 703 | 87% | 425 ms |

Quality 5 is already ahead of them, at seven milliseconds. The cliff is between
9 and 10: fourteen milliseconds becomes a hundred and sixty-seven, for seven
kilobytes. So q9 is the setting to default to — ahead of diamond-types, and
costing about what zstd costs — and q11 is for an archive that is written once.

Decompression does not have this problem: 2 ms, 292 MB/s, and that is the side
that runs whenever a document is opened.

This is also the honest answer to whether one of our own compressors should be
used instead. `go-compressions/deflate` accelerates match extension with SIMD,
but DEFLATE's density is what it is — 112 KB here — so the SIMD buys time on a
format that cannot reach the number. Where a SIMD brotli encoder would pay is
exactly the q10 and q11 rows, and what it would buy there is the 167 or 425
milliseconds rather than any bytes. q9 does not need it.

#### What is not decided by this

`Snapshot` says the same state is the same bytes, and every format change so far
has kept that. A compressor's output is deterministic for a build and not
promised across versions of the library, so compression belongs beside the
format rather than inside it: the canonical form stays the columnar bytes, and
whoever stores or sends them compresses. A plain whole-blob compression of the
columnar layout gives 97 811 rather than 96 703, which is the price of keeping
the boundary in the right place.

#### And so, version 5

The format writes the columns. Each is length-prefixed, so whoever stores a
snapshot can take them apart and compress them one at a time. Measured on the
same document: **115 KB with the standard library's flate**, against 148 for
version 4, and about 106 with brotli at quality 9 — under diamond-types' 109,
with the one dependency and without it we are level.

Small documents pay a little for it: nine column lengths is nine bytes, so the
version 2 fixture grows from 96 bytes to 105. This is a format for documents,
and a document with two runs in it is not the one the 478 KB came from.

#### And so, version 8

Version 5 gave every field a column and left every column one encoding, which is
a uvarint per value however many times that value is the same one. Version 8
gives a column groups: a run is a count and a value, and everything else is a
literal stretch. It also splits the deletion fields, which version 5 wrote as one
column of gap, span, site and step over and over, into four columns of one kind
of number each — interleaved, no two neighbours are alike and nothing repeats.

On automerge-paper, **478 474 bytes to 259 890**, and the three columns that
started [issue #88](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/issues/88) from 71 924 bytes
to twelve:

| Column | Version 6 | Version 8 | over |
|---|---|---|---|
| text | 182 315 | 182 244 | 182 315 values |
| run sequence steps | 20 449 | 20 452 | 10 824 |
| deletion sequence steps | 55 828 | **17 975** | 50 276 |
| origin sequence steps | 14 660 | 14 664 | 10 824 |
| run lengths | 11 005 | 10 918 | 10 824 |
| deletion counts | 10 850 | 9 038 | 10 824 |
| deletion spans | 50 297 | **3 048** | 50 276 |
| deletion gaps | 50 286 | **1 483** | 50 276 |
| origin sites | 10 824 | **6** | 10 824 |
| run sites | 10 824 | **4** | 10 824 |
| clocks | 10 824 | **4** | 10 824 |
| deletion sites | 50 276 | **4** | 50 276 |
| **total** | **478 438** | **259 840** | |

The threshold is measured rather than chosen. A run costs a count and a value;
leaving a pair in the literals costs the two values and nothing else, while
writing it as a run also costs the two group headers that cutting the literal
stretch in half needs. Over these twelve columns a threshold of two costs 266 270
bytes, three costs 259 840, four 259 808 and six 261 016. Three is where it
turns, and it is the smallest number at which no column here is larger than
writing it out plainly would have been — the two that are, run and origin
sequence steps, are three and four bytes larger.

**What this does not buy is compressed bytes.** Compressed per column, which is
what a store does, version 6 is 112 211 bytes with the standard library's flate
and version 8 is 110 487: 1.5%. Whole-blob gzip goes 115 897 to 112 522. A
general-purpose compressor was already finding almost all of this; what version 8
changes is the size of a snapshot nobody has compressed, which is what `DirStore`,
`MemoryStore` and every transport hold, and it halves it.

#### The compressed text chunk, and why nothing writes one

diamond-types LZ4s its text for any document over twenty bytes, and the obvious
next step here is the same thing with `compress/flate`. A version 8 column says
in its first byte how it is stored, and the reader understands a deflated one, so
a peer or a later release can send one without this build refusing the snapshot.
Nothing here sends one. The numbers are why:

| | Bytes |
|---|---|
| version 8 | 259 890 |
| version 8 with the text column deflated | **128 270** |
| version 8, compressed per column by whoever stores it | 110 487 |
| the same, with the text column deflated first | 110 512 |

It halves a snapshot nobody compresses and costs 25 bytes to everybody who does.
And it costs the promise directly above: `Snapshot` says the same state is the
same bytes, and two replicas on different builds of Go would stop agreeing about
a document they both hold. So the reader learns it and the writer does not, which
is the same order [#83](https://github.com/go-crdt/crdt/pull/83) shipped
`OpSuperseded` in. Writing it is one constant, and it wants a caller that stores
snapshots raw and does not need them comparable — which is a decision about
callers rather than about the format.

### Memory

Only where it can be read honestly. Yjs is JavaScript, so `heapUsed` after a
forced collection is its document; Automerge, Loro and diamond-types keep theirs
in WebAssembly linear memory, which `process.memoryUsage()` does not see, so
there is no figure for them here rather than a bad one.

| Implementation | Held after replay | Per visible character |
|---|---|---|
| **go-crdt/crdt**, today | **4 541 KiB** | **44.3 B** |
| yjs 13.6.33, `gc: true` (default) | 5 680 KiB | 55.5 B |
| yjs 13.6.33, `gc: false` | 7 256 KiB | 70.9 B |
| *go-crdt/crdt 0.4.0, when this was first taken* | *4 034 KiB* | *39.4 B* |

Per *visible* character, because that is the only count the two agree on: the
document ends with 104 852 characters, and we additionally hold 77 463
tombstones, which is where the per-stored-character figure at the top of this
page comes from. Yjs's
default `gc: true` discards deleted content, so the `gc: false` row is the
closer comparison — and we are below both.

Re-taken on 2026-09-30. **Yjs reproduces** — 5 680 KiB against the 5 678 first
published, and the `gc: false` row lands on 7 256, the bottom of the 7255–7573
that was recorded then. **Ours grew**, from 4 034 KiB at 0.4.0 to 4 541 today,
and the two sections below account for it: the index over runs, and the second
summary for UTF-16 offsets, which took a block header from 144 bytes to 160 and
the document from 4 372 KiB to 4 541. That growth was measured when it was made
rather than discovered here; what this table had wrong was only that it went on
quoting 0.4.0 while the rest of the page had moved on.

We are still below both Yjs rows, by less than the old number claimed: 44.3 bytes
per visible character against 55.5 and 70.9.

Ours read 4 541, 4 541 and 4 547 KiB over three runs — an earlier version of this
paragraph said it "varied by not one byte", which was true of 0.4.0 and is not
true now. Yjs read 5 680, 5 680 and 5 998 (`gc: true`) and 7 256 three times
(`gc: false`).

### What this does not say

- **These libraries do not all do the same job.** Automerge maintains a whole
  JSON document with history, rich-text marks and branch metadata; Yjs and Loro
  carry several shared types. This is a text CRDT. A trace of single-character
  text edits is the workload they all publish against, but it flatters the
  implementation that does least.
- **Yjs is JavaScript** and the rest are compiled. That it is 128× slower than
  compiled code on a tight per-character loop is not a defect in Yjs.
- The Yjs figure here is faster than the 5 714 ms dmonad publishes for the same
  benchmark, on newer hardware and without the update observer his harness
  registers. Our encoded size for Yjs, 159 929 bytes, matches his published
  `docSize` exactly, which is the check that this harness reproduces his.
- Automerge 3.4.1 measured **slower** than the 14 326 ms dmonad publishes, on
  faster hardware — he pins `@automerge/automerge@^2.1.10`. That was left
  uninvestigated here, and **3.5.0 has since settled it in the other direction**:
  3 875 ms, well under his figure, measured against 3.4.1 alternately on this
  machine at 26 843–28 731 ms. The `automerge-wasm` row is the same trace against
  Automerge's Rust core with the JavaScript document wrapper removed; at 3.4.1
  that removed about two thirds of the cost, and at 3.5.0 it **adds** cost — the
  wrapper is now twice as fast as the raw binding.
- Wrapping the whole Yjs replay in a single `doc.transact` makes it *slower*,
  9 406 ms against the 3 079 ms the same session measured for the per-edit form,
  so the form used here is both what Yjs's own benchmark does and the faster of
  the two.
- One `Automerge.change` per edit, rather than one for the trace, costs about
  101 µs/edit over the first 20 000 edits — Automerge's own benchmark batches,
  and this is why.

Reproduce all of it:

```sh
cd docs/comparison && npm install
CRDT_TRACE=…/automerge-paper.json.gz node --expose-gc bench.js yjs --runs 10
```

## Ten thousand clients on one file

The trace above is one person typing. This is the other question: what happens
when ten thousand of them are on the same document and the network is broken.

`TestAHundredClientsAndABrokenNetwork` is a hundred by default and takes its
size from the environment. What it does to them: partitions lasting several
rounds, batches that never arrive at all, delivery shuffled and duplicated,
clients that arrive long after the session started and are welcomed with a
snapshot, clients that lose their connection **and go on typing**, clients that
come back and have to be reconciled in both directions, clients that close the
tab for good, processes restarted from a snapshot, and replicas throwing away
what they were holding back. Everybody types near the front, so the same
characters are contended.

The claim, checked two ways: once the network heals, every client holds a
**byte-identical** snapshot, and each agrees with itself — the index against the
list it indexes, the counters against the blocks they count.

| | 100 clients | 10 000 clients |
|---|---|---|
| rounds | 120 | 150 |
| wall clock | 2.7 s | 2 m 08 s |
| edits | 16 813 | 11 151 |
| batches delivered / lost / duplicated | 48 245 / 7 005 / 778 | 13 556 / 4 849 / 310 |
| reconciliations | 7 686 | 5 210 |
| joined late / disconnected / reconnected / left | 69 / 50 / 26 / 2 | 7 085 / 6 185 / 4 052 / 441 |
| edits made while disconnected | 3 167 | 1 959 |
| restarts from a snapshot | 47 | 33 |
| operations dropped while parked | 19 723 | 66 |
| **agreeing at the end** | **95** | **9 586** |
| the document | 5 713 characters, 2 404 tombstones | 5 144 characters, 489 tombstones |

The test refuses to pass if the chaos did not happen: no losses, no duplicates,
no restarts, no reconciliations, nobody joining, disconnecting, reconnecting or
leaving, no offline edits, no deletions, or an empty document all fail it.

Ten thousand clients do not each hold a connection to the other nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine, so the harness has what a real deployment has: a
hub they sync against, which arbitrates nothing and is a replica like any other.
Without it the run still converges and proves less — every client edits its own
almost-empty copy and they meet once at the end. With it, three quarters of the
edits land on a document somebody else has already been writing.

### What actually grows with the number of clients

A replica's memory is a function of the document, not of how many people are
editing it: ten thousand clients each hold one document, and the document is the
same size whoever holds it. (The 26.9 GiB above is this harness holding ten
thousand of them in one process.)

One thing does grow. A version vector carries an entry per site that has ever
written, it is exchanged on every sync, and `OpsSince` walks it:

| sites | version | per site | `OpsSince`, nothing owed | snapshot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 201 B | 2.0 B | 0.97 µs | 1 017 B |
| 1 000 | 2 876 B | 2.9 B | 11.04 µs | 12 647 B |
| 10 000 | 29 876 B | 3.0 B | 95.67 µs | 129 649 B |
| 100 000 | 383 495 B | 3.8 B | 821.16 µs | 1 550 509 B |

Linear, at about ten nanoseconds a site, which is what a map lookup costs. Said
plainly for a deployment: a server telling ten thousand clients "you are up to
date" once a second spends about a second of one core doing it, and reads a
thirty-kilobyte version for each answer. That is the price of asking "what am I
missing" with per-site vectors. It is not a defect and there is nothing cheaper
to do inside a call that is handed the vector; batching or sharding it is the
job of the protocol above.

A composite's version is per part **and** per site, so it multiplies: 1 000 sites
cost 4 758 bytes over one part and 47 979 over sixteen. That is the same argument
`structured.Blocks` is built on, measured at the version rather than the part.

## Synthetic benchmarks

On a document of 10 000 characters:

| Benchmark | 0.1.0 | 0.2.0 | 0.3.0 | 0.4.0 | 0.5.0 | today |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `InsertAtEnd` | 231 ns | 65 ns | 34.8 ns | 32.9 ns | 33.7 ns | **36.4 ns** |
| `ApplyRemote` (10 000 operations) | 823 µs | 441 µs | 302 µs | 279 µs | 295 µs | **351 µs** |
| `Load` | 1.48 ms | 1.02 ms | 830 µs | 756 µs | 613 µs | **747 µs** |
| `String` | 34.7 µs | 31.0 µs | 27.4 µs | 23.7 µs | 23.6 µs | **24.6 µs** |
| memory, one run | 107.7 B/char | 73.1 | 4.19 | 4.20 | 4.19 | **4.19** |
| `ScatteredInsert` † | | | | 12.3 µs | 0.37 µs | **0.41 µs** |
| `SameOriginFlood` (5000 operations) | | | | 27.3 ms | 1.07 ms | **1.23 ms** |

`go test -run '^$' -bench . -benchmem`. The last two arrived with 0.5.0; their
0.4.0 column is the same benchmark run against the release before it.

The 0.5.0 column holds two changes and a busy machine, so it was taken beside the
commit before it in the same session, which read 32.9 ns, 291 µs, 607 µs, 24.0 µs
and 4.19 B/char. `Load` is the run-length snapshot format; what the index costs
here is under a nanosecond of `InsertAtEnd` and 4 µs of `ApplyRemote`.

**The `today` column was taken beside the 0.5.0 one**, not quoted across the
fifty releases between them: both trees built and run alternately, six rounds
each, medians. Measured that way the commit the 0.5.0 column describes reads
34.98 ns, 304.89 µs, 641.27 µs, 25.23 µs and 1.17 ms — within 4–8% of what it
published, which is what says the comparison is between the two versions and not
between two sessions. Fifty releases cost 15% on `ApplyRemote` and 16% on `Load`
and nothing anywhere else.

### † A benchmark whose answer depended on how long you ran it

`ScatteredInsert` inserted into a document it never stopped growing: one
character per iteration, from the same `b.N` loop whose length Go chooses by
ramping until a second has passed. So its answer was a function of `b.N` — and
therefore of how fast the machine was that day, in the direction nobody expects.
**A faster machine reaches a larger `b.N`, inserts into a larger document, and
reports a worse figure.**

On the commit that first published this row, that same code reads:

| `-benchtime` | ns/op | the document it ends on |
|---|---|---|
| 1000x | **370** | 11 000 characters |
| 10000x | 490 | 20 000 |
| 500000x | 945 | 510 000 |
| 1000000x | 1 300 | 1 010 000 |
| *default (1s), here, today* | *1 246–1 514* | *1 010 000* |

The **0.37 µs** this table used to quote is the 1000x reading. Nothing was wrong
with the measurement; what was wrong was treating it as a quantity the code has.
Run the same command on this machine today and it prints 1.3 µs — not because
anything regressed, but because a second now buys a million iterations.

The benchmark now rebuilds its document whenever it grows past 110% of
`benchSize`, with the timer stopped, so the thing being measured is an insertion
into a document of about ten thousand characters, which is what the row claims.
It reads 360–410 ns from a hundred thousand iterations upward, and the default
budget is thirty times that.

**And there was no regression.** With the bounded benchmark run alternately on
both trees, the 0.5.0 commit reads 405.8 ns and today reads 410.6 ns — 1.01×. The
published 0.37 µs was about right for what it names; it just could not be
obtained twice.

## What changed, and why

### The position mark, and then a list that walks both ways

Finding a rune offset means walking the document. The first measurement was
blunt: inserting at the end of a 10 000-character document took **68 052 ns**
against 218 ns at the start, and the whole difference was the walk. Remembering
where the last local edit ended took that to 231 ns.

That mark only helped forwards, which the real trace exposed immediately: a
replay that should have taken milliseconds took **2.79 seconds**, because half
the edits move the cursor back a little and every one of those walked from the
start of the document. Blocks now carry a back pointer and the walk goes
whichever way it must, and a deletion re-establishes the mark instead of dropping
it.

**2.79 s → 50 ms on the real trace, a factor of 56**, and it is the single change
that put this in the same range as the fastest implementations rather than an
order of magnitude behind them.

### Characters indexed by sequence number, not by identity

Integration finds a character from the identity an operation names. That was a
`map[ID]*item`, and the map cost about as much again as the character it pointed
at. It was never needed: a site's sequence numbers start at one and have no gaps,
and `Apply` refuses an operation until its predecessor has landed, so **position
in a slice is the sequence number**.

107.7 → 73.1 bytes per character, and the write path halved — a map insert per
character cost more than all the list work around it.

### Run-length blocks

A character used to be a struct of its own: identity, clock, origin pointer,
rune, deletion, next. Everything but the rune is derivable. A block is a run of
characters one site typed consecutively, and for character *k* of that run the
identity is `{site, seq+k}`, the clock is `clock+k`, and the origin is character
*k-1*. A thousand characters typed in a row cost one header and their text.

Blocks are only ever split — by an insertion landing inside one — and extended,
by the next character of the same run. There is no merging to do: a new character
can never bridge two existing blocks, because that would need the sequence number
the right-hand block already holds. Integration walks runs rather than
characters, because within a run the clocks ascend, so whichever way the "sorts
after the new character" test goes at the first character of a run holds for the
whole run.

**73.1 → 4.19 bytes per character** on a document typed in one run, and the
index shrank with it: it now holds one entry per run rather than one per
character.

### Waiting operations filed under what they are waiting for

A peer that sends a long history back to front used to be quadratic: every
arrival rescanned everything still parked. Delivering the real trace in reverse —
337 000 operations, none applicable until the last — took **210 seconds**.

Operations now wait in a map keyed by the single operation each needs, so
integrating one wakes exactly its dependents. **210 s → 0.30 s.**

### Deletions stored as stretches

A block used to keep one deletion identity per character as soon as any
character in it died — 2289 KiB of the 4015 the real trace occupied, and half of
those entries described characters that were still visible.

A record now covers a whole stretch: characters `[from, to)` removed by one
site's operations `seq, seq+1, …`, so the operation that removed character
`from+k` is `seq+k`. Backspacing over a word is one record rather than one per
letter. The contiguity is enforced, not assumed — a deletion joins the record
beside it only when its identity continues that record's sequence.

Measuring first was worth it: the trace's 77 463 tombstones collapse to 50 276
records, 1.5 characters each, because most are scattered corrections rather than
long runs. That put the honest expectation at 2289 → 1178 KiB rather than the
larger figure a guess would have promised.

The speed-up was the surprise. **54.6 ms → 24.4 ms on the real trace**, because
everything that walks a block — the text, the positional search, counting what is
visible — now steps over stretches instead of testing characters one at a time.

One simplification fell out and is worth stating, because it looks like a missing
case: a deletion can only ever *extend* the record ending where it lands. It can
never fill a gap between two records, or lead into one, because a site's
operations are applied in sequence order — a record whose identities follow this
deletion's cannot already exist.

### The snapshot format writes runs

`Snapshot` wrote one record per character: identity, clock, origin, the
character, and its deletion — eight numbers each, twenty-five bytes per visible
character of a real document. Comparing against other implementations made it
plain that nobody else pays that.

Version 2 writes a run at a time — one header for a stretch one site typed
consecutively, then its text, then the stretches of it that have been deleted —
because everything about the characters in a run follows from the first one.
**2 663 KB → 260 KB on the real trace, 25.4 → 2.5 bytes per visible character**,
and writing it is twelve times faster.

Version 1 was read until #99, so a document stored by an older build opened; the
test for that used a snapshot produced by the v0.4.0 release rather than one this
build wrote, because a fixture regenerated by the code it checks proves nothing.
It went with the rest of versions 1 to 6: nothing holds those bytes, the project
is in development, and every number quoted in this file is a measurement of a
format, not a promise to read it.

Two things had to be true for this to work, and one of them was not free. The
runs written have to be the same on every replica holding the same operations,
or a snapshot stops being a convergence check. The blocks themselves already
are — two that continue one another are never adjacent, because a character
bridging them would need the sequence number the right-hand one already holds —
but their *deletion records* are not: cutting a block divides a record, and
replacing one character's deletion when two replicas delete it at once cuts
another. Writing them joined hides that. The randomised convergence suite found
this immediately, by comparing encoded state rather than text.

### An index over the runs

The list answers "what follows this" in a step and everything else by walking,
which the mark makes cheap only while the next position is near the last one. Two
things it is not cheap for, and the second is not a matter of taste:

- a position far from the last edit — a second cursor, a replace-all, a patch
  dropped into the middle, or simply a peer's operation arriving between two
  keystrokes and clearing the mark — walks every run in between;
- integration walks forward from the origin over everything that sorts after the
  new character, so a peer naming one origin over and over makes the walk the
  length of the document. `collab`'s server integrates what its peers send, and
  peers need not be honest.

The blocks are now the nodes of an AVL tree in document order as well as links in
the list, each carrying two summaries of its subtree: the visible characters it
holds, which turns a position into a descent, and the block of it that sorts
lowest, which turns that integration walk into one too. Measured back to back
against the release before it, on the same machine in the same session:

| | 0.4.0 | 0.5.0 | |
|---|---|---|---|
| the real trace, replayed | 23.4 ms | **18.4 ms** | −21% |
| 2000 inserts at scattered positions in a 12 000-run document | 12.3 µs each | **0.37 µs** | 33× |
| 5000 operations at one origin | 27.3 ms | **1.07 ms** | 26× |
| 20 000 operations at one origin | 370 ms | **4.6 ms** | 80× |
| the real trace, applied as a peer's operations | 50.9 ms | 52.9 ms | +4% |
| memory held on the real trace | 22.66 B/char | 24.56 B/char | +8% |
| `InsertAtStart` | 93.2 ns | 140 ns | +50% |

The flood is the one to read twice. Its cost per operation was 2.8 µs at 2500
operations, 5.6 at 5000, 10.2 at 10 000 and 18.5 at 20 000 — doubling with the
document, which is the quadratic stated below. It is now 193 ns, 214, 231 and
231: flat, because a subtree whose lowest-sorting block still sorts after the new
character holds nothing to stop on and is stepped over whole.

The trace got faster rather than slower because real editing is not as local as
the mark assumes: a fifth of the replay was walking.

Both walks keep their heads. Each starts along the list and turns to the tree
only after sixteen runs, which is about what a descent costs, so typing pays
nothing for the index and never sees it.

Three numbers went the wrong way, and all three are the same number. The index
costs 32 bytes a run — three pointers, a count and a height, which takes a block
header from Go's 112-byte size class to its 144-byte one — and on the trace that
is 338 KiB. `InsertAtStart` inserts one character per run at one end, so it pays
a walk to the root of the tree per character and nothing else amortises it; it is
the index's worst case by construction. Applying a whole history allocates
everything from nothing, and a profile of it is dominated by the allocator rather
than by anything in `tree.go` — the 4% is that 8% of memory, arriving as
collector work.

A B-tree holding runs in its leaves, as diamond-types does, would pay for itself
here: no per-run node, a depth of four rather than seventeen, and iteration from
the leaves. It costs the pointer identity of a block, which the mark, the
per-site index and every walk in `text.go` are written in terms of.

#### The arithmetic, since it was measured rather than guessed at

A block is **152 bytes**, and Go's size classes here are sixteen bytes apart, so
it is allocated in the **160-byte class**: eight bytes of every block are paid
for and unused. `TestBlockFitsItsSizeClass` pins this so it cannot drift.

The tail is what decides it. `subMin` ends at 136; `subVis` and `subSup` fill the
word to 144 exactly; `nsup` and `height` spill past it and cost a whole further
word. Five bytes of summary buy sixteen bytes of allocation, on every block.

Shaving that tail was looked at and rejected, which is worth recording so the
next person does not look at it again:

- `height` is an AVL height, computed from its children. It is structural, not a
  priority that could be derived from the block's identity and dropped.
- `nsup` could become a single bit — every use of it outside `split` is a test
  against zero — but that alone leaves the block at 148 bytes, which is the same
  size class. Nothing is saved.
- Reaching 144 means capping `subVis` or `subSup` so that `height` can live in
  the spare bits. A subtree's visible count is already `int32` for a stated
  reason: two billion characters is eight gigabytes of text. Capping it lower
  trades a bounded, honest limit for one that fails as silent corruption.

So the block cannot lose a size class without giving something up, and what it
would save is about 4% of what a real document holds.

#### What the other answer is worth

The B-tree removes the per-run node rather than shrinking it, and that is a
different order of answer. `TestWhatTheBTreeWouldBuy` measures it the same way,
by declaring the shapes and asking Go:

| A run | Allocated | |
|---|---|---|
| today | 160 B | |
| with no per-run index node | **112 B** | 30% less |
| and iterating from the leaves | **96 B** | 40% less |

The second line drops `left`, `right`, `up`, `subMin`, `subVis`, `subSup` and
`height`; the third drops `next` and `prev` as well, since a B-tree iterates from
its leaves and the backwards walk those exist for is what the index replaced.

On the real trace that is **676 KiB of the 4 541 the document holds, about 15%**
— against the 4% shaving the tail would have bought, for a change that gives up
nothing. The B-tree's own internal nodes are not free, but at any sensible
branching factor they are a few percent of the leaves.

That was the case for spending a project on it. It was spent, and the prize did
not survive contact — see below.

#### It was built, and it does not pay

The B-tree exists on the `perf/btree` branch: runs in the leaves, summaries in
the parent, the AVL removed, the whole suite green on the real trace, and its
answers compared against the AVL's on 104 852 positions and 10 050 integration
walks before either was taken out.

The table above is right about a run: 152 bytes becomes 120, which is the
128-byte class instead of the 160-byte one. What it is wrong about is the
sentence that follows it — that the internal nodes are a few percent of the
leaves. They are not, because the leaves are not free either. A node carries one
entry per thing below it, and an entry is two counts, the lowest-sorting key of
what it holds, and a pointer: twenty-four bytes against the thirty-two a run
gives back, before the slack of a node that is not full.

That leaves one trade, and it was measured at both ends:

| index | the document holds | allocations, integration walk |
|---|---|---|
| the AVL, today | **4 541 KiB** | **15.1k** |
| B-tree, each node sized to what it holds | 4 389 KiB (−3.3%) | 30.1k (+99%) |
| B-tree, each node with room to grow | 5 062 KiB (+11.5%) | 16.8k |

A node sized to what it holds recopies all of its summaries on every insertion,
which doubles the allocations of the walk the index exists to protect and cost
22% of its time. A node with room to grow allocates like the AVL and costs more
memory than it saves. The saving in the first row *is* the recopying; they are
the same fact read two ways.

Nothing here is an argument against the shape. The depth is five rather than
seventeen and the descent is a scan of one cache line. It is an argument that a
per-run node costs about what a per-run entry costs, so replacing one with the
other buys nothing — and that is worth knowing before anyone spends the project
again.

### A second summary, for UTF-16 offsets

Addressing the document in UTF-16 code units means turning a count of units into
a count of characters, and the obvious way to do that is to walk the document
counting. That is O(n) per keystroke, so the index carries a second summary
instead — the visible characters of a subtree that take two code units, beside
the count of visible characters it already carried — and a conversion becomes a
descent.

The cost was measured before it was decided to keep the summary, because one
nobody needs is still paid for by everybody. Both builds were run alternately in
one session on a machine under a load average of nine, so that whatever the
machine was doing landed on both; `benchstat`, n=14 on the trace and n=12 on the
synthetic benchmarks.

| | before | after | |
|---|---|---|---|
| the real trace, replayed | 20.60 ms ± 3% | **20.74 ms ± 1%** | ~ (p=0.27) |
| the real trace, as a peer's operations | 100.2 ms ± 14% | **104.2 ms ± 14%** | ~ (p=0.76) |
| `InsertAtEnd` | 49.10 ns ± 6% | **48.88 ns ± 16%** | ~ (p=0.68) |
| `ApplyRemote` | 410.4 µs ± 7% | **407.1 µs ± 10%** | ~ (p=0.93) |
| `InsertAtStart` | 199.0 ns ± 2% | **211.9 ns ± 9%** | ~ (p=0.07) |
| `ScatteredInsert` | 1.791 µs ± 7% | **1.903 µs ± 3%** | ~ (p=0.07) |
| `SameOriginFlood` | 1.656 ms ± 9% | **1.702 ms ± 6%** | ~ (p=0.44) |

Nothing moved by a distinguishable amount, and the trace — which is ASCII, and
so should not have moved at all — did not. The two rows that come closest,
`InsertAtStart` and `ScatteredInsert` at about +6% with p=0.07, are the two
benchmarks that allocate one block per character, which is where the memory
below is charged rather than the arithmetic.

The memory is exact, and it is the real cost:

| | before | after | |
|---|---|---|---|
| a block header | 144 B | **160 B** | +16 B |
| held on the real trace | 4372 KiB | **4541 KiB** | +3.9% |
| per stored character, real trace | 24.56 B | **25.51 B** | +3.9% |
| `MemoryPerCharacter`, 10 000 characters in one run | 4.19 B/char | **4.19 B/char** | — |

The summary is two `int32`s: the visible supplementary characters below a block,
and the supplementary characters the block itself holds, deleted ones included.
Sixteen bytes rather than eight, because the header was 141 bytes in Go's
144-byte size class with three bytes spare — *any* field, of any width, takes it
to the 160-byte class. A single `bool` would have cost exactly what these two
counters cost, which is why they are two counters and not a compromise.

The second of them is what keeps the work off documents with no emoji in them. A
block that holds no supplementary character answers every question about UTF-16
units without reading a character, so splitting one or indexing one stays
arithmetic instead of becoming a scan. And a document with none anywhere
converts in constant time without touching the index at all, because its rune
and UTF-16 offsets are equal by construction: `InsertAtEndUTF16` measures 44.9 ns
against `InsertAtEnd`'s 48.9, and 46.5 ns on the same document with one emoji
added, which is the descent.

## Where the memory goes now

Measured on the real trace: 10 824 blocks holding 182 315 characters, of which
77 463 are tombstones, in 4.4 MiB.

| | |
|---|---|
| block headers | ~1690 KiB |
| text | 712 KiB |
| deletion records | ~1180 KiB |

The remaining lever is still the block headers, now 160 bytes each.

## Complexity

| Operation | Cost |
|---|---|
| `Insert` or `Delete` near the last edit | O(distance in characters), which is what locality makes small |
| `Insert` or `Delete` cold | O(log runs) |
| `Apply` an insertion | O(log runs) |
| `Apply` a deletion | O(log runs of the target's site), then O(records in the run) |
| an operation arriving before its dependencies | O(1) to park, O(1) to wake |
| `String`, `Snapshot`, `OpsSince` | O(characters, alive and tombstoned) |

Both logarithms are the tree in `tree.go`, reached after sixteen runs of walking
the list. Nothing an untrusted peer sends can make either of them worse: the tree
is an AVL tree, balanced by height rather than by priorities a peer could
compute, and a peer that could choose the priorities could choose a list.

Adding a run to the tree costs a walk to its root, which typing amortises over a
whole run of characters — the change a keystroke makes is held against the block
and carried up when the tree is next read — but which one character per run does
not.
